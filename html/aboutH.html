                        <h3>What is homeopathy?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Homeopathy or homeopathic practice,
                         is a medical system that was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago .
                          It’s based on two theories:
                          
                        </p>
                        <p><li><p> “Like cures like”—the notion that a disease can be cured by a substance which produces similar symptoms in healthy people.
                          This concept of ‘law of similars' was also stated by Hippocrates and Paracelsus.</p>
                        
                        <img src="../images/about-h.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                            But Dr. Hahnemann established it on a scientific blueprint despite the fact
                             that he lived in the age when modern scientific methods were almost unknown.
                        </p>

                                “Law of minimum dose”—the notion that
                                 after some threshold dilution, the lower the dose of the medication, the more its effectiveness.
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:2em;">
                                Homeopathic products come from plants (such as red onion, arnica,
                                 poison ivy, belladonna -deadly nightshade, minerals such as white
                                  arsenic,zinc, calcium etc., or animals.
                                   Homeopathic products are often made as sugar pellets to be to be 
                                   consumed orally and also in other forms such as ointments, gels, drops, creams, and tablets by 
                                   a standard method called dynamisation or potentisation, which 
                                comprises of successive dilutions and succussions to raise the inherent curative power of the drugs to maximum.

                                Treatments are based on “individualization” or —it’s common for different
                                 people with the same condition to receive different treatments.

                  <p>
                    These are some common misconceptions and myths about homeopathy.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>MYTH: </strong> “HOMEOPATHY IS UNSCIENTIFIC”</p>
                  <p><strong>REALITY : </strong>  There is a large body of evidence from scientific research data
                    , control clinical studies and clinical outcome trials conducted by various molecular biologists, 
                    physicists and nanotechnologists all around the world who have proven that homeopathy is scientific.

                  <p><strong>MYTH: </strong> “HOMEOPATHY IS UNSCIENTIFIC”</p>
                  <p><strong>REALITY : </strong>  There is a large body of evidence from scientific research data
                    , control clinical studies and clinical outcome trials conducted by various molecular biologists, 
                    physicists and nanotechnologists all around the world who have proven that homeopathy is scientific.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>MYTH: </strong> “HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICINES ACT SLOWLY”</p>
                  <p><strong>REALITY : </strong>It depends upon TIME duration and SEVERITY OF DISEASE (SOD)
                    Homoeopathy acts in diarrhea, fevers, allergies, in acute attacks of asthma,
                    disorders of menstruation, troubles of  children and many more. Unfortunately,
                     many times people go to a homeopath as a last hope and by then the disease would have progressed much.
                     Severity of disease increases with time.For faster results please try to contact your homeopath in early stages of disease.
                </p>
                <p><strong>MYTH: </strong> “HOMOEOPATHY CANNOT TREAT SERIOUS  MEDICAL CONDITIONS”</p>
                <p><strong>REALITY:</strong>  
                    Homoeopathy is just like any other medical system wherein various
                     conditions from acute to chronic can be treated. You can avoid surgery
                      by taking homeopathic medicines in cases such as Hernia, cyst, allergic
                       sinusitis and many more. In short, you can approach a homeopath from ‘C’ to ‘C’ i.e., from Cold to Cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the severity of the disease, homoeopaths guide the 
                        patients whether to take medication or to go for surgery.
                         Every homeopath is well aware of the scope and limitations of his system.

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>MYTH: </strong>“HOMOEOPATHIC DOCTORS ARE NOT QUALIFIED ENOUGH AND ARE UNPROFESSIONAL””
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>REALITY : </strong> In India, it takes 5 and half years to graduate as a homeopathic doctor. Homoeopathy is recognized by an Act of the Parliament.</p>
